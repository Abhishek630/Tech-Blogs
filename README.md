How much JavaScript is necessary to learn React?



There is no hard and fast rule to start learning React. However, basic programming knowledge, preferably in JavaScript is a must to understand the concepts that we are going to apply and learn.

Here are some of the concepts which I feel one should look into as per my experience:

1. let, var and const: We should know what is the difference between them and where to use them. Along with that, one should have a solid fundaments of data types.

2. Conditional and Loops : As I already mentioned, one should know how to use loops, specially the "ForEach" loop.

3. Functions and Arrow Functions: How to write and call a functions and Arrow Functions. What is the difference between Functions & Arrow functions. What is lexical in Arrow Function.

4. Event Handling :Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions.

5. Promises & Async/Await: In order to understand the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, we should have understand these concepts very well. 

6. map()/filter()/reduce(): Map, reduce, and filter are all array methods in JavaScript. Each one will iterate over an array and perform a transformation or computation. Each will return a new array based on the result of the function.

7. Module exports and imports

Again, I would say there is no hard and fast rule to start learning react. React is a library which provides ways to easily write the code and develop. But, one should atleast understand these topics in order to not to get overwhelmed.
